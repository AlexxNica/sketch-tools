This Sketch plugin is a collection of tools we commonly use at Khan Academy.

##Tools

######Select Parent Artboards

Selects the parent artboards of the current selection when you press **⌃⌘A**.

######Select Layers Convertible to Outlines

Selects only layers that can be converted to outlines (text layers and shape layers with borders).

###### Select Text Layers

Selects only text layers.

#### Export

###### To Zeplin

Exports the selected artboards to Zeplin when you press **⌘⌥E**. This is an improvement over Zeplin's official Sketch plugin in that it redlines layers in subartboards of the artboard you're exporting.
